MIT BOOTCAMP MERN STACK WEB PORTFOLIO

View the site here --> https://valorieb.github.io/valoriebroderick.github.io/

This is a web portfolio I am creating for my MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. 
It's designed to showcase my work to potential future employers.

More will be added here as the project progresses.
